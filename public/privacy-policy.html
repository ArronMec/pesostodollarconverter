        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pesos to Dollar Converter ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our currency converter application ("App").</p>

            <li><strong>Purchase Information</strong>: Subscription purchase data is handled entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not have access to your payment information, billing address, or other financial details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
